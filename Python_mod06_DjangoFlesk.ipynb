        "\n",
        "Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It's classified as a microframework because it doesn't require specific tools or libraries. Unlike some other frameworks, Flask doesn't have a database abstraction layer, form validation, or other components. Instead, it relies on pre-existing third-party libraries for these functions. However, Flask does support extensions that can add application features as if they were native to Flask. These extensions can provide functionalities like object-relational mapping, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask is a web framework that allows developers to build lightweight web applications quickly and easily with Flask Libraries. It was developed by Armin Ronacher, leader of the International Group of Python Enthusiasts(POCCO). It is basically based on the WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 templating engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask is a lightweight Python framework for web applications that provides the basics for URL routing and page rendering.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask is called a \"micro\" framework because it doesn't directly provide features like form validation, database abstraction, authentication, and so on. Such features are instead provided by special Python packages called Flask extensions. The extensions integrate seamlessly with Flask so that they appear as if they were part of Flask itself. For example, Flask doesn't provide a page template engine, but installing Flask includes the Jinja templating engine by default. For convenience, we typically speak of these defaults as part of Flask."

        "\n",
        "* MTV (Model, Template, View): Django follows the MTV design pattern, which is a variant of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. In Django:\n",
        "\n",
        "> *Model: Defines the database structure, including tables, relationships, and fields.\n",
        "> * Template: Handles presentation and how information is displayed to the user.\n",
        "> * View: Controls what is shown to the user, making decisions based on user input or a request.\n",
        "* ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): Django comes with a built-in ORM that allows developers to interact with the database as if they were pure Python objects, without the need to write SQL queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Automatic Admin Interface: Django includes an automatic admin interface, which is a web-based administration tool auto-generated based on the model definitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Security: Django provides protection against many common web application security issues, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and SQL injection.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Friendly URLs: Django promotes the use of friendly and readable URLs, which is beneficial for both usability and SEO.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Extensibility: Django is highly extensible, with an \"apps\" architecture that allows developers to break a project into multiple reusable applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Active Community: Django has an active and vibrant community that contributes packages, tools, and documentation. This means there are plenty of resources available for learning and troubleshooting.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Documentation: One of Django's strengths is its detailed and high-quality documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Django is suitable for developing both small web applications and large, complex ones. It's used by many well-known organizations and websites, including Instagram, Pinterest, and The Washington Post, among others.\n"

        "\n",
        "One of the best features of Python is that it enables one to pack of all similar functions or variable definitions in a **single file**. These can then be used in other Python scripts or interpreters as well. These files in Python are Python modules. The functions or variables can be imported from a module directly using the import statement into others\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, a module is a **single file** containing Python definitions and statements. These definitions and statements can include variables, functions, and classes and can be used to organize related functionality into a single, reusable package. Module organizes and reuses code in Python by grouping related code into a **single file**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modules in Python are just Python files with a** .py** extension. *The name of the module is the same as the file name*. A Python module can have a set of functions, classes, or variables defined and implemented.\n",
        "\n",
        "The modules are entities that allow a logical organization and division of the code with the ultimate goal of its reuse, thus the definitions of a module can be used by other modules.\n",
        "\n",
        "The use of modules allows breaking down large programs into smaller and more manageable files, which offers, among other advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "> * Simplicity: Dividing a problem into simpler parts facilitates its development and reduces the number of errors.\n",
        "> * Maintainability: Modules that focus on a particular domain tend to minimize interdependencies, reducing the likelihood that changes to a single module will impact other parts of the program.\n",
        "> * Reuse: The functionality defined in a module can be easily reused eliminating the creation of duplicate code.\n",
        "> * Scope: Modules define a separate namespace, which helps prevent collisions between identifiers in different areas of a program.\n",

        "Modules allow us to organize the code in a single .py file with Python code.\n",
